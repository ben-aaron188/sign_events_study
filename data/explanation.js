To achieve this, we ask the participants to give a statement about the most important leisure activity for them in the upcoming week.</br></br>Procedure of this experiment</br>You will be instructed to either tell the truth about your most important activity or to lie about. We randomly allocated participants to these two groups. If you are instructed to lie, we will assign you an activity that you have to pretend to be doing. Be as convincing as possible in your answer. This experiment takes circa 5 minutes for which you receive GBP 0.60.</br></br>Voluntary basis</br>If you decide to refrain from taking part in this research, this will have no consequences to you whatsoever. If you decide to stop during the research, this is possible at any time without providing additional explanation, and without consequence.

In addition, your answers will be used for academic research purposes to determine how difficult it is to identify whether someone lied or told the truth. If this study may lead to a publication, the data will be published anonymously, and will thus be untraceable to individual participants.
